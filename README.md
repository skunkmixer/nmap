### How to install and use nmap
Nmap is a linux-based command-line tool used for network exploration and security auditing. Although it can be 
used on windows, it is easiest to use on linux. 
**If your OS is a linux distro**
You can simply type in the command 'sudo apt install nmap' in the terminal.
*Note that if you are running Kali Linux nmap will be preinstalled.*
**If your OS is Windows or other**
The easiest way is to use a virtual machine. I highly recommend using *virtualbox*.
It is a free and open-source VM perfectly suited for this task. To install Kali linux on virtualbox please click [here] (https://phoenixnap.com/kb/how-to-install-kali-linux-on-virtualbox)
